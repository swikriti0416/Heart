# Heart Drawing with Python Turtle

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes the Turtle module to draw a heart shape.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Python programming language

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python heart.py
    ```

5. Sit back and watch as the heart shape is drawn!

## How it Works

The heart shape is generated using mathematical functions to define the x and y coordinates of the points that form the shape. The `hearta` and `heartb` functions define these coordinates based on trigonometric calculations. The Turtle module is then used to draw lines between these points, resulting in the heart shape.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script to change the color, size, or speed of the drawing. You can modify the values in the script or explore additional features provided by the Turtle module.
